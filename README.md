## üöÄ Getting Started

The easiest way to use `mcpscan` is to download the latest pre-compiled binary for your operating system from the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/tmquan2508/mcpscan/releases/latest)**.

1.  Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/B·∫†N/mcpscan/releases/latest).
2.  Find the asset that matches your OS and architecture (e.g., `mcpscan-windows-amd64.exe`).
3.  Download the file, and you're ready to run it from your terminal.

## Usage

The tool is controlled via command-line flags. The `--host` (or `-h`) flag is required.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
# On Linux/macOS
./mcpscan -h < host | hosts.txt > [flags]

# On Windows
.\mcpscan.exe -h < host | hosts.txt > [flags]
```

### Examples

**1. Scan a single server on the default port:**
```bash
./mcpscan -h hypixel.net
```

```bash
./mcpscan -h my-server.com -s 25500 -e 25600 -o found.txt
